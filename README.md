# Blockchain Overview

## Traditional Networks vs. Blockchain
Traditional applications run on centralized servers, which can fail or be controlled by a single entity. In contrast, blockchains operate on a network of independent nodes. This decentralization ensures that even if some nodes fail, the blockchain remains operational. Blockchains offer immutability and resilience. As a result, they act as decentralized databases that can also perform decentralized computations.

## Consensus
Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), are crucial for blockchain functionality. PoW requires nodes to solve computationally heavy problems to validate transactions. This ensures fair competition among nodes. PoS involves validators staking their coins as collateral to propose and validate blocks. This offers a more environmentally friendly alternative.

## Proof of Work
PoW is a sybil resistance mechanism where miners solve complex puzzles to add blocks to the blockchain. It involves significant computational effort and energy consumption. The longest chain rule, used by Bitcoin and previously by Ethereum, helps determine the valid blockchain by considering the chain with the most blocks.

## Blockchain Attacks
Blockchains face two major types of attacks. Sybil attacks are where an entity creates many pseudo-anonymous accounts to influence the network. The 51% attacks are where an entity controls the majority of the network's computational power. Decentralization helps mitigate these risks. This makes blockchains more secure as they grow.

## Proof of Stake
Misbehaving validators risk losing part or all of their stake through a process called slashing. This serves as a deterrent against dishonest behavior rather than directly ensuring honesty.

## Layer 1 and Layer 2
Layer 1 solutions are base layer blockchain implementations like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions, such as Chainlink and Arbitrum, are built on top of Layer 1 to address scalability issues. These protocols use rollups to bundle transactions for processing by Layer 1 blockchains.
