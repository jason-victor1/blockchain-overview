# Blockchain Overview

## Traditional Networks vs. Blockchain
Traditional applications run on centralized servers, which can fail or be controlled by a single entity. In contrast, blockchains operate on a network of independent nodes. This decentralization ensures that even if some nodes fail, the blockchain remains operational. Blockchains offer immutability and resilience, acting as decentralized databases that can also perform decentralized computations.

## Consensus
Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), are crucial for blockchain functionality. PoW requires nodes to solve computationally heavy problems to validate transactions, ensuring fair competition among nodes. PoS involves validators staking their coins as collateral to propose and validate blocks, offering a more environmentally friendly alternative.

## Proof of Work
PoW is a sybil resistance mechanism where miners solve complex puzzles to add blocks to the blockchain. It involves significant computational effort and energy consumption. The longest chain rule, used by Bitcoin and previously by Ethereum, helps determine the valid blockchain by considering the chain with the most blocks.

## Blockchain Attacks
Blockchains face two major types of attacks: Sybil attacks, where an entity creates many pseudo-anonymous accounts to influence the network, and 51% attacks, where an entity controls the majority of the network's computational power. Decentralization helps mitigate these risks, making blockchains more secure as they grow.

## Proof of Stake
PoS involves validators staking their coins to propose and validate blocks. Misbehaving validators lose their stake by ensuring honesty. PoS is more energy-efficient than PoW but raises questions about decentralization due to upfront staking costs.

## Layer 1 and Layer 2
Layer 1 solutions are base layer blockchain implementations like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions, such as Chainlink and Arbitrum, are built on top of Layer 1 to address scalability issues. These protocols use rollups to bundle transactions for processing by Layer 1 blockchains.
